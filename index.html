<h1>Mark Van Wormer Website</h1>
<ul>
<p>Hello! My name is Mark Van Wormer and you have stumbled upon my website... 
    I am currently a senior here at Northern Illinois University studying OM&IS with a minor in 
    Business Analytics! I anticipate on graduating in May 2019 and possibly getting going to grad school.
    In my free time I enjoy learning new skills and overall bettering myself. I also enjoy nature, cars, and animals.
    I believe this will be a fun class and am very eager to learn.</p>
